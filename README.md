# CS Society's Offical Website

This is the repository for the CS Society's official website. The website is built using Next JS 14.

## To create an event post:
- Create a markdown file inside the eventposts directory named `event-post.mdx` for any given 'event-name'.
- Inside the markdown file add meta values for `'title'`, `'date'` and `['imgList']` of their respective types.
- For the cover image, navigate to `public\img\events` and then add the cover image as `event-name.png`.
- For other images add their corresponding names to the ['imgList'] with the value as `/img/events/image-name.png`
