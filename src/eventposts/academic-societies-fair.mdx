The Academic Societies Fair at Ashoka is an annual event designed to introduce the University’s incoming class to the pre-existing academic societies. The Computer Science Society, for its introduction on September 18, 2023, chose to engage the student body by presenting an array of games like Charades, Wordle, and Flip the Cup—all tailored to resonate with computer science themes. 

Furthermore, the Society organised a coding challenge designed to test participants' ability to identify anomalies in code. The challenge presented participants with a different result from what the code in front of them would produce. The goal was to recognise and fix the coding anomalies to produce the correct result as quickly as possible. Top rankers were awarded with goodies.
