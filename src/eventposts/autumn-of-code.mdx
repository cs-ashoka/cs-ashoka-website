Autumn of Code was a month long celebration of open source organised by the Computer Science (CS) Society in collaboration with the Women in Computing Society (WiCS). Inspired by Hacktoberfest, it aimed to bring together Ashokan developers, enthusiasts, and beginners to build for their campus. Autumn of Code commenced with a typing challenge dubbed !keyBored. Participants gathered round for a 1 v 1 keyboard battle—and all their scores were later moved to a common leaderboard. Winners were awarded coupons. 

After this launch, during the mid-term break, three projects were chosen by a dedicated in-society team assembled just for AOC (Autumn of Code). All projects were related to on campus issues faced by Ashokans, chosen based on various polls and conversations. They were then opened to the student body to contribute to. From fixing bugs to adding new features, the projects’ aim was to help participants build their skills and connect with fellow coders. To ensure participants gained the most from this experience, the CS Society and WiCS came together to host a help desk and coding sprint, partnered with IEEE to hold a Computational Bio Workshop, and set up various stalls to introduce more participants to the world of coding. One notable stall (with IEEE) also contributed to fundraising initiatives for kids in STEM. 

Towards the end, AOC culminated with a Modern Family inspired Pub Quiz. Participants came in teams or as individuals, and were tested on their tech knowledge—losing teams had to face consequences while winning teams were awarded with AOC themed prizes ranging from plants to food coupons.
