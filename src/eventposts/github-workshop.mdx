The CS Society hosted a 90 minute workshop in which Mihir Aggarwal introduced students to the basics of Git and GitHub. This was held in September 2023. The event saw ~50 students, mostly sophomores wanting to get comfortable with GitHub before their Data Structures course.

The workshop covered the following:

- Introduction into the world of open source and to the popular platforms used for open source development.
- Overview of GitHub and its purpose through popular open source repositories such as the Node.js repository.
- Hands on creation of a GitHub profile and a walkthrough of the GitHub interface.
- Deeper look into the specifics of repositories, commits, forks, pull requests, and issues to name a few.
- Demo of how one can contribute to open source projects by solving an issue on a sample repository.
- Introduction of version control and hands on installation of Git.
- Guided implementation of an initial GitHub commit all the way from cloning and initializing a repository to making changes and pushing them to GitHub using Git.
