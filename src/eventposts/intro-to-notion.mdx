Intro to Notion was the CS societyâ€™s first major event of the 2023-24 Academic year, where we invited students to a special workshop that could help them stay organized, boost productivity, and take control of their college life.

Conducted on 6th September 2023, it was an interactive session where we provided a step-by-step walkthrough on how to utilize Notion to create a comprehensive college tracker tailored for Ashoka students.

The dashboard empowered students to become more efficient by keeping track of their notes, readings, submissions, and deadlines in a streamlined and easily accessible manner.

We had a fruitful evening with approximately 50 students across batches and majors who were interested in exploring the potential of Notion as an everyday tool.
